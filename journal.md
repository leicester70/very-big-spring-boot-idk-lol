> I've been playing [Mindustry](https://mindustrygame.github.io/). Each time use a router in that game, all I can think of are Load Balancers. Its really fun to things splitting. I see the similarities from the things I do at work. I've yet to learn about `Load Balancers` and `OAuth`. I'm thinking of changing my function in my organization. I've no idea where to go next, but not as much as the concern of whether I am able to even clique with anyone regardless my next assignment.

> I'll try to implement one simple one, here, where I can freely follow my own rules. After all it is my own learning. I learn better with practical before theory. The plan however, is instead experiment. First I try coding something with whatever little knwowledge I've gained thus far.

> I was able to pull off what I've learned from work. That is not to say that work was easy, but out of the pain, I made a servicing API, simple one, Not so fucking bad, pretty proud of myself. I've made a 'base' now I can continue to add shit to it. Yes, whatever the fuck I want. Who cares if its a mess with fuck all use caseandWorst practices only lmfao. Ultimate troll app lol. Just wait guys just wait.
